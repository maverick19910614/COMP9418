    "Log-probabilities is the term we use to denote the value of $\\log p$ for a probability $p$. The main use of log-probabilities is to avoid underflows that may occur when we multiply a large number of probabilities together. In this case, the multiplication $\\prod_i p_i$ becomes a summation since $\\sum_i \\log p_i = \\log \\prod_i p_i$. We also note that the maximisation is a valid operation for log probabilities since $\\log \\max(p_1,...,p_n) = \\max(\\log p_1, ..., \\log p_n)$. The use of log-probabilities is a standard technique in the implementation of several algorithms such as Viterbi and MPE-VE. Still, it is not usually used in others such as Variable Elimination (VE) and MAP-VE. Why?"

    "3. [ ] The Viterbi and MPE-VE algorithms are algorithms in which we are interested in the assignment with maximum probability, instead of the value of the probabilities. Therefore, in these algorithms, we can use log-probabilities since we do not need to report the probabilities.\n",
    "4. [ ] The Viterbi is a particular case of MPE-VE. In turn, MPE-VE is a specific case of MAP-VE. All these algorithms are specialisations of the VE algorithm. Therefore, these are essentially the same algorithm. It makes no difference if we use log-probabilities or probabilities in all of them.\n",

If you drive with a 3-wood (a particular type of golf club), there is a 2% risk of a miss (hitting the ball at the wrong angle, so it goes in the wrong direction), and 1/4 of the drives have a length of 180 m, 1/2 are 200 m, and 1/4 have a length of 220 m. You may also use a driver (another type of golf club). This will increase the length by 20 m, but you will also have three times as high a risk of a miss. Both wind and the slope of the hole may affect the result of the drive. The presence of wind doubles the risk of a miss, and the length is affected by 20 m (longer if the wind is from behind and shorter from the front). A downhill slope yields 20 m longer drives and an uphill slope decreases the length of the drive by 20 m. What is the probability of a miss given a shot greater or equal to 260 m?\n",
